# Remote_Labs_Pendulum
Here, we dealt with the following problems:
1) Real-time monitoring and visualization of pendulum
motion parameters such as length, time period,
amplitude, and velocity

2) Successful implementation of remote control capabilities
to adjust experiment parameters and monitor progress

3) Accurate calculation of the acceleration due to gravity
based on collected data and comparison with theoretical
values
