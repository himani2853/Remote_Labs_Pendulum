# Remote_Labs_Pendulum
Here, we dealt with the following problems:
1) Real-time monitoring and visualization of pendulum
motion parameters such as length, time period,
amplitude, and velocity

2) Successful implementation of remote control capabilities
to adjust experiment parameters and monitor progress

3) Accurate calculation of the acceleration due to gravity
based on collected data and comparison with theoretical
values

Here, we used BLYNK IOT application for our interface, we linked the application with our hardware devices such as Servo motors, IR Sensors with the help of Arduino IDE (Microcontroller - ESP 8266) which was further used to actuate the motion of pendulum. This further involved changing the length of pendulum with just a click. All the values - instantaneous and average are displayed in the Blynk interface at the same time.

This way we observed the motion of simple pendulum and calculated the value of g remotely.
